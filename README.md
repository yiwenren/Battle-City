# Something about Battle-City
This is a simple version of Battle City. The player, controlling a tank, can destroy enemy tanks.

In my version, I tried to implement most of functions in the classic Battle City.

The tank of player has a blood bar to show its life. Everytime it is attacked, the blood will decrease 20%.

The actions of enemy tanks are totally random, including their direction, stay or move, shooting or not. They cannot destroy each other.

The tanks cannot get through each other and can only move in this area.

The brick walls are the obstacles for tanks. Tanks can't go through it, but the walls cannot be destroied.

Player can choose to continue game by press "F2" after the tank dies. 

The small jumping magenta rectangle in the middle of the game is blood for player. If player's tank eats it, the blood of tank will become full.

I add pictures for bomb to make it vivid,
