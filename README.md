# Something about Battle-City
This is a simple version of Battle City. The player, controlling a tank, can destroy enemy tanks.

In this version, I tried to implement most of functions in the classic Battle City.

The tank of player has a blood bar to show its life. Everytime it is attacked, the blood will decrease 20%.

The actions of enemy tanks are totally random, including their direction, stay or move, shooting or not. They cannot destroy each other.

Tanks cannot get through each other and can only move in the panel area.

Brick walls are the obstacles for tanks. Tanks can't go through it, but the walls cannot be destroied.

Players can choose to continue game by press "F2" after the tank dies. 

The small jumping magenta rectangle in the middle of the game is blood for player. If player's tank eats it, the blood of tank will become full.

Here is a screenshot of the game, a boom effect is added to make the graphic vivid.
